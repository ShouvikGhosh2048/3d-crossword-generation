# 3d-crossword-generation
A Flask API for generating crosswords for [3D crossword](https://github.com/ShouvikGhosh2048/3d-crossword).

It uses OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo for word and description generation, and a greedy search for word placement.

To use this project, you'll need to set an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the OpenAI API key and then run main.py with Flask.
